				<h2>My Process of Learning to Play Violin</h2>
				<p>I started playing violin at the age of 13. First I learnt the musical notes and the sounds of these notes on my violin. There were times I felt like giving up because it took me a while to get better at it. I was inspired by best friend who played the piano. As kids, I used to duets with her. My passion for music began from then. I grew better at violin by practicing hard everyday. From getting coached to performing at recitals and school events, I could play gracefully and with confidence. Personally, I think jam sessions are the best way to improve your skills as a vioin player - the fear of feeling left out, playing the wrong note, missing a note and not knowing the conventions is the scary part. But once you face it, it will make you best prepared. My favorite violinist is Samvel Yervinyan, he usually performs with Yanni.</p>
				<p>Some of my favorite violin music:</p> 
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Vivaldi: The Four Seasons, Violin Concerto in E Minor</li>
					<li>Rundo Alla Turca</li>
					<li>21 Hungarian Dances in D-Flat Major</li>
					<li>Symphony No.40 in G Minor</li>
					<li>8 Humoresques, No.7</li>
					<li>Polonaise de Concert in D Major</li>
				</ol>
