				<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p>Hello! My name is Sanjana Parikh. I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, graduating in May 2022. I'm studying Industrial Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm from Ahmedabad, India and I've lived there for 18 years of my life. A few of my hobbies are playing violin and listening to music, reading and photography. I'm a co-founder of an NGO (est. 2018) in my hometown, which helps underpriviliged girls in rural areas to get higher-level education. This personal blog is the perfect place if you are looking for free-time hobbies after a long-day of work, to relax and have a good time. I hope you enjoy it, and get to know me a little better!</p>
